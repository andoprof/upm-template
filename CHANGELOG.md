# Change Log:
## 1.0.0
	- Enhancement: Updating documentation to the latest folder structure and content specs, such as linking to the `Samples~` section in the Unity's documentation instead of saying, "as of this writing, there is no official documentation" (when there obviously is, now.)


## 1.0.0
	- Initial release:
	- Confirmed the template project works by battle-testing it to [Ads Manager - Unity Package](https://github.com/andoprof/upm-template.git) package.
	- Updated every text to be more generic.
